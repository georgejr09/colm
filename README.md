# Colm Suite

The Colm Suite is a unified distribution of two closely related language tools:

- **Colm** (COmputer Language Machinery): A programming language designed for the analysis and [transformation of computer languages](https://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/TransformationSystems). Influenced primarily by [TXL](https://www.txl.ca/).

- **Ragel**: A state machine compiler that generates executable finite state machines from regular expressions and state machine specifications.

The two projects share components and have a build dependency, so a unified
repository simplifies development and building. The significant links are:

- The **FSM library** (`src/libfsm/`) -- finite state machine construction and manipulation, used by both Colm and Ragel.
- The **code generation intermediate language** (`src/cgil/`) -- written in Colm, used by both projects for target language code generation.
- Ragel's **frontend is written in Colm** (`src/ragel/*.lm`), so Colm must build first to bootstrap Ragel.

## Versioning

Every shipped component is versioned independently: colm, ragel, libfsm,
cgil and aapl each carry their own number, declared in `configure.ac`.
Suite releases are calendar-versioned snapshots of the components:
`colm-suite-YYYY.MM`, zero padded, with a micro appended for fixup
releases (`2026.08`, then `2026.08.1`).


## Colm

### What is a transformation language?

A transformation language has a type system based on formal languages.<br>
Rather than defining classes or data structures, one defines grammars.

A parser is constructed automatically from the grammar, and the parser is used for two purposes:

- to parse the input language,
- and to parse the structural patterns in the program that performs the analysis.

In this setting, grammar-based parsing is critical because it guarantees that both the input and the structural patterns are parsed into trees from the same set of types, allowing comparison.

### Features

- Colm's main contribution lies in the parsing method.<br>Colm's parsing engine is generalized, but it also allows for the construction of arbitrary global data structures that can be queried during parsing. In other generalized methods, construction of global data requires some very careful consideration because of inherent concurrency in the parsing method. It is such a tricky task that it is often avoided altogether and the problem is deferred to a post-parse disambiguation of the parse forest.
- By default Colm will create an elf executable that can be used standalone for that actual transformations.
- Colm is a static and strong typed scripting language.
- Colm is very tiny and fast and can easily be embedded/linked with c/cpp programs.
- Colm's runtime is a stackbased VM that starts with the bare minimum of the language and bootstraps itself.

### Examples

This is how Colm is greeting the world ([`hello_world.lm`](doc/colm/code/hello_world.lm)):
```colm
print "hello world\n"
```

Here's a Colm program implementing a little assignment language ([`assign.lm`](doc/colm/code/assign.lm)) and its parse tree synthesis afterwards.
```colm
lex
	token id / ('a' .. 'z' | 'A' .. 'Z' ) + /
	token number / ( '0' .. '9' )+ /
	literal `= `;
	ignore / [ \t\n]+ /
end

def value
	[id] | [number]

def assignment
	[id `= value `;]

def assignment_list
	[assignment assignment_list]
|	[assignment]
|	[]

parse Simple: assignment_list[ stdin ]

if ( ! Simple ) {
	print( "[error]\n" )
	exit( 1 )
}
else {
	for I:assignment in Simple {
		print( $I.id, "->", $I.value, "\n" )
	}
}
```

More real-world programs parsing several languages implemented in Colm can be found in the [`grammar/`](grammar/) folder.

### Colm usage

To immediately compile and run e.g. the `hello_world.lm` program from above, call

```
$ colm -r hello_world.lm
hello world
```

Run `colm --help` for help on further options.

```
$ colm --help
usage: colm [options] file
general:
   -h, -H, -?, --help   print this usage and exit
   -v --version         print version information and exit
   -b <ident>           use <ident> as name of C object encapulaing the program
   -o <file>            if -c given, write C parse object to <file>,
                        otherwise write binary to <file>
   -p <file>            write C parse object to <file>
   -e <file>            write C++ export header to <file>
   -x <file>            write C++ export code to <file>
   -m <file>            write C++ commit code to <file>
   -a <file>            additional code file to include in output program
   -E N=V               set a string value available in the program
   -I <path>            additional include path for the compiler
   -i                   activate branchpoint information
   -L <path>            additional library path for the linker
   -l                   activate logging
   -r                   run output program and replace process
   -c                   compile only (don't produce binary)
   -V                   print dot format (graphiz)
   -d                   print verbose debug information

```


## Ragel

Ragel compiles regular expressions and state charts to executable finite state
machines. The generated code can be output in a variety of host languages.

### Supported target languages

C, C++, D, Java, Ruby, C#, Go, OCaml, Rust, Julia, Zig, JavaScript, GNU ASM x86-64, and
Crack.

### Code generation backends

| Flag | Style |
|------|-------|
| `-T0`, `-T1` | Table-driven |
| `-F0`, `-F1` | Flat table-driven |
| `-G0`, `-G1`, `-G2` | Goto-driven |

Language-specific binaries are also available: `ragel-c`, `ragel-go`, `ragel-rust`,
`ragel-zig`, etc.

See the [`examples/`](examples/) directory for sample Ragel programs.


## Building

### Dependencies

- make
- libtool
- gcc
- g++
- autoconf
- automake

For the documentation, install [`asciidoc`](https://asciidoctor.org/) and [`fig2dev`](https://github.com/getlarky/fig2dev) as well.

### Build instructions

```
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```

### Installing one half of the suite

Colm and ragel install together by default. The two halves can be installed
separately, which is useful for a ragel user who has no interest in colm, or a
colm user who has no interest in ragel:

```
$ ./configure --disable-install-colm    # ragel only
$ ./configure --disable-install-ragel   # colm only
```

The whole tree is still built either way. Ragel's parsers are written in colm,
so colm has to be built before ragel can be, and building everything keeps the
test suite runnable from the build tree. Only the install step is narrowed.

Two things go out in both cases and cannot be excluded from a ragel-only
install: the colm runtime library, which the ragel programs link, and the aapl
headers, which the installed libfsm headers include.

### Building with CMake

CMake (3.16 or later) is supported as an alternative to autotools. It builds the
same set of programs and libraries and reads the version numbers out of
`configure.ac`, so there is no need to run `autogen.sh` or `configure` first.
Only out-of-source builds are supported.

```
$ cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
$ cmake --install build
```

Options:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COLM_MAKE_INSTALL` | `ON` | Generate install rules. |
| `COLM_INSTALL_COLM` | `ON` | Install the colm program and its development files. |
| `COLM_INSTALL_RAGEL` | `ON` | Install ragel, its host backends, libragel, libfsm and cgil. |
| `COLM_BUILD_EXAMPLES` | `OFF` | Build the ragel examples under `examples/`. |
| `BUILD_STANDALONE` | `ON` on Windows | Link the executables statically. |
| `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` | `OFF` | Build libcolm, libfsm and libragel as shared libraries. |

`COLM_INSTALL_COLM` and `COLM_INSTALL_RAGEL` are the cmake spelling of
`--disable-install-colm` and `--disable-install-ragel`; see [Installing one half
of the suite](#installing-one-half-of-the-suite) for what each one covers.

All executables are written to `build/bin`, which is where the `ragel` driver
expects to find the per-host-language backends (`ragel-c`, `ragel-go`, ...).

The install exports cmake packages, so a dependent project can do:

```cmake
find_package(colm REQUIRED)   # colm::colm, colm::libcolm
find_package(ragel REQUIRED)  # ragel::ragel, ragel::libfsm, ragel::libragel
```

The autotools build remains the reference build. Known differences:

- The run-from-the-build-tree detection described below relies on libtool, so a
  colm built by cmake always uses the install location to find its includes and
  runtime library. Install it before using it to compile colm programs.
- The test suite under `test/`, the documentation under `doc/` (including the
  ragel man page), and `colm-wrap` are autotools-only. A cmake install
  therefore cannot serve as the `--with-colm` target of an autotools build.
- Libtool builds both a static and a shared library and versions libcolm and
  libfsm with `-release` (`libcolm-<version>.so`). CMake builds one flavour,
  selected by `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`, and versions all three with a soname
  (`libcolm.so.0`).
- `--enable-pool-malloc`, `--with-ragel-kelbt`, `--with-colm` and the
  large-file-support checks have no cmake equivalent.

### Run-time dependencies

The colm program depends on GCC at runtime. It produces a C program as output,
then compiles and links it with a runtime library. The compiled program depends
on the colm library.

To find the includes and the runtime library to pass to GCC, colm looks at
`argv[0]` to decide if it is running out of the source tree. If it is, then the
compile and link flags are derived from `argv[0]`. Otherwise, it uses the install
location (prefix) to construct the flags.


## Testing

```
$ make check
```

Test suites are under `test/` with subdirectories for each component (`colm.d`, `ragel.d`, `aapl.d`, etc.).
